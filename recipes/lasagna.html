  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish made with wide, 
    flat sheets of pasta layered with various fillings such as meat 
    ragù, béchamel sauce, and cheeses like Parmesan, ricotta, and 
    mozzarella, then baked until hot and bubbly.</p>
  <p>The term "lasagna" can refer to both the individual pasta sheet 
    and the entire dish, though in Italian, "lasagne" (plural) refers 
    to the pasta sheets, while "lasagna" (singular) is used for the 
    dish in southern Italy.</p>
  <p>The dish is believed to have originated in Emilia-Romagna, 
    particularly Bologna, where it is traditionally made with green 
    pasta (colored with spinach) and layered with ragù and béchamel.</p>
